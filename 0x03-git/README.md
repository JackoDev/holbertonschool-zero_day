0x03. Git
Foundations - 0-Day ― 0-Day

This is the 0X03 - Git project on the zero day at Holberton
We learn a little of history about control versions software, configure git and
github and a bit more.

3. Collaboration: be up to date
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.
